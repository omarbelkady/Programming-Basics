ZeroDivisionError: The operation you are trying to perform is not possible because you are dividing by zero. Division
by 0 is not allowed

NameError: This is raised whenever you try to use a variable that you have not defined yet.

TypeError: This is raised whenever you try to perform an operation with two non-identical datatypes. The compiler will raise
an error telling you you cannot convert the 2nd datatype to the first datatype.

We can overcome errors by using conditionals: try-except block, if else statement, while loop

Syntax Error: You have a typo or are misusing a statement/reserved keyword correctly for example:
while True print('MY NAME IS OMAR')

The above line of code will error because I am missing a colon.
It should be:
while True:
      print('MY NAME IS OMAR')
